# HSI_Lidar_SAR_multimodal_fusion_calssification_toolkit


This repository proposed a new taxonomy to descibe existed patch based image classification (semantic segmenation) models.

Based the input and output of the model, we categorized these pixel-level classification model into singlesacle singlemodality input and singleoutput (SSISO), singlesacle multimodelity input and singleoutput (SMISO), singlesacle multimodelity input and multioutput (SMIMO), mutlisacle multimodelity input and singleoutput (MMISO), mutlisacle multimodelity input and multiouput (MMIMO).

Of course, there are multiscale singlemodality input, singleoutput (MSISO) and multiscale singlemodality input and multioutput (MSIMO) and so on. We will continue and add them in this framework.

I have collected a range of models based this taxonomy. If you want to contribute this repository and make it better, feel free to contact me. My emial : quanwei.liu@my.jcu.edu.au
